## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are props in React?
  Props are a little like attributes in React components. They are bits of information that are passed in a JSX tag that can be changed by the parent component to enable flexibility and reuse.

- How do you declare and access props in a component?
  First you pass the props as arguments in the child component. Within the child component, you input the prop name where you want the value to be stored. Now in the parent component, within the child component JSX tag, you declare the props with the value you would like after the assignment operator.

- How do you pass props to a component?
  To pass a prop you must input the value desired into the child's tag within the parent element.

- How do you write JavaScript expressions in JSX?
  You must wrap the expression in curly braces {}.
